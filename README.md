- Selection Sort :
  O(N^2) In place sorting algorithm, no additional storage (not stable, not adaptive)
- Buble Sort :
  O(N^2) Stop the sorting process early if the list is sorted ( stable, adaptive)
- Insert Sort
  O(N^2) Best case for an already sorted list is O(N) ( stable, adaptive)
- Shell Sort
  O(N^2) Average case complexity O(N * log N) (adaptive)
  Shell's intervals or Increments N/2, N/4, N/8, N/16, ..
- Merge Sort
  O(N * log N) Divide and conquer algorithm for sorting ( stable, not adaptive)
- Quick Sort
  O(N * log N) Divide and coquer sorting technique
